# COP3504C

Written by Daniel Li.

This is my code for Advanced Programming Fundamentals (COP3504C) at the
University of Florida, taken during the Fall 2024 semester. All solution code in
this repository is my own work. This course develops skills in Python and C++.

Each lab or project directory contains a `README.pdf` file with instructions for
the lab or project. Sometimes, sample output is provided, which I usually name
`sample-output.txt` or similar. Instructions and any supplementary modules and
resources are taken directly from the course files.

Although the recommended software for the course includes PyCharm and CLion, I
make do with Neovim and Windows Terminal.

Most of the Python code in this repository is developed under Python 3.12,
although it should work for older versions since I'm not trying to do anything
fancy.

The C++ code in this repository is organized using the Meson build system. I am
a Linux user at heart, but as I am currently stranded on a Windows machine, I am
forced to use the MinGW toolchain instead of native GCC. I am aware that I have
access to the Ubuntu CISE servers, but I decided not to go that route because it
requires a stable internet connection.
