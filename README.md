# COP3504C

Written by Daniel Li.

This is my code for Advanced Programming Fundamentals (COP3504C) at the
University of Florida, taken during the Fall 2024 semester. All solution code in
this repository is my own work. This course develops skills in Python and C++.

Each lab or project directory contains a `README.pdf` file with instructions for
the lab or project. For some labs and projects, sample output is provided in a
file named `sample-output.txt` or similar. These instructions and any
supplementary files/modules are taken directly from the course files.

The recommended software for the course includes PyCharm and CLion; however,
this is not mandatory, and I have been able to make do with Neovim and Windows
Terminal.

Most of the Python code in this repository is developed under Python 3.12,
although it should work for older versions, as I don't try to do anything fancy.

The C++ code in this repository is organized using the Meson build system,
rather than the recommended CMake. Although I am a Linux user at heart, I am
currently stranded on a Windows laptop, so I am forced to use the MinGW
toolchain instead of native GCC. I am aware that I have access to the Ubuntu
CISE servers, but I decided against going that route because I would like to be
able to work offline.
