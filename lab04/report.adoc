1. Why is a search for `"not_here"` the worst-case for linear search and binary search?
+
`"not_here"` is not in the list,
so the linear search traverses the entire list before deciding the element is not present.
The binary search must also perform the maximum number of comparisons,
splitting the list in half until no possible matches are left.

2. Why is a search for `"mzzzz"` the average-case for linear search?
+
`"mzzzz"` happens to be at nearly the exact center of the list,
so the linear search algorithm must traverse half of the list before finding it.

3. Why is a search for `"aaaaa"` the best-case for linear search?
+
`"aaaaa"` is at the very beginning of the list,
so the linear search algorithm finds it immediately.

4. How do the results you saw compare to the Big-O complexity for these algorithms?

5. Why do the binary search results appear so similar, while the linear search results are so divergent?
